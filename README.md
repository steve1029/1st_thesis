# Numerical solvers for Maxwell's equations.
Scripts that has been used for my first paper.
Various solvers such as FDTD, PSTD and hybrid PSTD-FDTD(HPF) methods has been developed.
All of the contents in this repository was moved to SHPF.
For users interested in my paper, please see the repository `steve1029/SHPF`.
